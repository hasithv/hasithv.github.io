## 2.2.1 - Definition and first examples

> **Definition 2.2:** A *symmetric monoidal structure* on a preoirder $(X, \leq)$ consists of
> - (i) a *monoidal unit*, $I \in X$
> - (ii) a *monoidal product* $\otimes: X \times X \rightarrow X$
>
> And the monoidal product $\otimes(x_1,x_2) = x_1 \otimes x_2$ must also satisfy the following properties (assume all elements are in $X$)
> - (a) $x_1 \leq y_1$ and $x_2 \leq y_2 \implies x_1 \otimes x_2 \leq y_1 \otimes y_2$
> - (b) $I \otimes x = x \otimes I = x$
> - (c) associativity
> - (d) commutivity/symmetry
> 
> (a) is called *monotnoicity* and (b) is *unitality*

**Remark 2.3:** replacing $=$ with $\cong$ in definition 2.2 will give us a *weak monoidal structure*.

> **Exercise 2.5:** The preorder structure $(\mathbb{R}, \leq)$ and the multiplication operation $\times$ will not give us a symmetric monoidal order because of the simple counter example of $-2 \times -2 \nleq 1 \times 1$.

> **Example 2.6:** A *monid* is similar to a symmetric monoidal preorder in that it consists of a set $M$, a function $*: M\times M \rightarrow M$, and an elment $e \in M$ called the *monid unit*, such that for every $m,n,p \in M$,
> - $m * e = m$
> - $e * m = m$
> - associativity holds
> 
> Further, if commutivity holds (which isn't not generally true),  then it is also called *commutative*

## 2.2.2 - Introducing wiring diagrams
:warning: I am seeing the wiring diagrams, but I fail to understand why they are any different from the Hasse diagrams we've seen previously.
