This is a collection of my notes for Brendan Fong and David Spivak's [_An Invitation to Appied Category Theory_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05316). The first chapter was done through LaTeX, but the rest should be markdown with mathjax.
- [Chapter 1 - Generative effects: Orders and adjunctions](/1.pdf)
- Chapter 2 - Resource theories: Monoidal preorders and enrichment
    - [Section 2.2 - Symmetric monoidal preorders]({{< relref "chap2/index.md" >}})
