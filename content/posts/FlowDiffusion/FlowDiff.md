Here are my notes for MIT CSAIL's course titled [_Introduction to Flow Matching and Diffusion Models_](https://diffusion.csail.mit.edu/). While I am finding the labs very helpful and making sure I do them, I will not be documenting my progress on them here.

- Lecture 1 - [Flow and Diffusion Models]({{< relref "lec1/" >}})
- Lecture 2 - [Constructing the Training Target]({{< relref "lec2/" >}})
- Lecture 3 - [Flow Matching and Score Matching]({{< relref "lec3/" >}})
