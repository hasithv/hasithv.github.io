      <description>The Puzzle Inspired by true events
Alice is assigned to be the 56th passenger to board a full plane with 60 seats. However, a panic causes all the passengers&amp;ndash;including Alice&amp;ndash;to arrange themselves radomly in line to board.
As Alice was originally 56th, she decides that she would be happy as long as passengers with the assigned spots 57, 58, 59, and 60 are not in front of her. What is the probability that Alice will be happy?</description>

<p><em>Inspired by true events</em></p>
<p>Alice is assigned to be the 56th passenger to board a full plane with 60 seats. However, a panic causes all the passengers&ndash;including Alice&ndash;to arrange themselves radomly in line to board.</p>
<p>As Alice was originally 56th, she decides that she would be happy as long as passengers with the assigned spots 57, 58, 59, and 60 are not in front of her. What is the probability that Alice will be happy?</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>The only passengers we need to consider are Alice and passengers 57, 58, 59, and 60&ndash;since for each arrangement of these 5 passengers, there is an equal amount of ways to arrange all other 55 passengers.</p>
<p>Thus, the probability will simply the number of ways we can arrange these 5 passengers such that Alice is in front of passengers 57, 58, 59, and 60 divided by the total number of ways to arrange these 5 passengers:</p>
$$ 4!/5! = 1/5$$]]></content:encoded>

      <title>That&#39;s not how Probability Works!</title>

      <description>I was recently doing a probability puzzle that I can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember the context of, but I came across the answer that the probability would be $$\mathbb{P}(X) = n p^n \; \quad \forall \: n\in\mathbb{N}, p \in [0,1].$$But this is obviously wrong! Plug in $p=.9, n=2$, and you get that $\mathbb{P}(X) = 1.62$. Thaat&amp;rsquo;s not how probability works! However, for $p=0.5$, $\mathbb{P}(X)$ will remain $\leq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently doing a probability puzzle that I can&rsquo;t quite remember the context of, but I came across the answer that the probability would be
</p>
$$\mathbb{P}(X) = n p^n \; \quad \forall \: n\in\mathbb{N}, p \in [0,1].$$<p>But this is obviously wrong! Plug in $p=.9, n=2$, and you get that $\mathbb{P}(X) = 1.62$. Thaat&rsquo;s not how probability works! However, for $p=0.5$, $\mathbb{P}(X)$ will remain $\leq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. So, somewhere in the interval $(0.5,0.9)$, we reach a critical value where any $p$ greater than that will result in a probability greater than one, and any value less than it will be a bit more reasonable.</p>
<p>So, what is this critical value that will help me save face?</p>
<p>Well, the question we are trying to answer, phrased a bit more formally, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>find the largest $p \in [0,1]$ such that $np^n \leq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}.$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, we rephrase the problem by stating
</p>
$$np^n \leq 1 \iff p^n \leq \frac{1}{n}.$$<p>Visually, this means that the exponential graph of $f_p(n) = p^n$ can never go above $g_p(n) = \frac{1}{n}$ for some fixed $p$. From this, we can deduce that the critical value of $p$, which we will denote as $p_0$, will satisfy the following relation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the parametrized forms of $f_p$ and $g_p$
</p>
$$F_{p}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
t \\
f_p(t)
\end{bmatrix}, \; 
G_p(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
t \\
g_p(t)
\end{bmatrix},$$<p>
the critical $p_0$ value will be such that
</p>
$$F_{p_0}(t_0) = G_{p_0}(t_0),\text{ and } \dot{F}_{p_0}(t_0) = \lambda \dot{G}_{p_0}(t_0)$$<p>
for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}, t_0 \in \mathbb{R}^+$. In other words, their velocities will point in the same direction (and, perhaps more intuitively, the outward normals of each curve will be parallel, so the graphs &lsquo;kiss&rsquo; at some $t_0$ with the choice of $p_0$).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we have a fairly simple problem to solve. Because the $x$ component of $F$ and $G$ are always equal, we immediately find that $\lambda = 1$ for their time derivatives to be equal to each other. Now, that leads us to solve for a $p_0$ and $n$ such that
</p>
$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{p_0}(t_0) &= g_{p_0}(t_0) \\
    \implies p_0^n &= \frac{1}{t_0}
\end{aligned}
$$<p>
and
</p>
$$
\begin{aligned}
     \dot{f}_{p_0}(t_0) &= \dot{g}_{p_0}(t_0) \\
    \implies -\ln(p_0)p_0^n &= \frac{1}{t_0^2}
\end{aligned}
$$<p>
So, rather unsatisfyingly, we boiled it down to a system of nonlinear equations
</p>
$$
\begin{cases}
    p_0^n = \frac{1}{t_0}, \\
    \ln(p_0)p_0^n = -\left(\frac{1}{t_0}\right)^2
\end{cases}
$$<p>
which I cannot solve, but Desmos tells me that $p_0 \approx 0.6922$ and $t_0 \approx 2.7181$.</p>
<p>Thus, my answer would have been reasonable in <em>some</em> convoluted scenario in which $p < 0.6922$.</p>
<p>(This answer, too, is not totally right! This is because there may be a larger $p$ value that satisfies $np^n \leq 1$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ but <em>not</em> for $n\in \mathbb{R}^+$. We solved for the $n \in \mathbb{R}^+$ case, which would technically give us a lower bound for $p_0$. Taking this into consideration, our $p_0$ value would really be $p_0 \approx 0.6934$)</p>
