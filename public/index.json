So, somewhere in the interval $(0.5,0.9)$, we reach a critical value where any $p$ greater than that will result in a probability greater than one, and any value less than it will be a bit more reasonable.\nSo, what is this critical value that will help me save face?\nWell, the question we are trying to answer, phrased a bit more formally, is:\nfind the largest $p \\in [0,1]$ such that $np^n \\leq 1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}.$\nFirst, we rephrase the problem by stating $$np^n \\leq 1 \\iff p^n \\leq \\frac{1}{n}.$$ Visually, this means that the exponential graph of $f_p(n) = p^n$ can never go above $g_p(n) = \\frac{1}{n}$ for some fixed $p$. From this, we can deduce that the critical value of $p$, which we will denote as $p_0$, will satisfy the following relation:\nGiven the parametrized forms of $f_p$ and $g_p$ $$F_{p}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} t \\\\ f_p(t) \\end{bmatrix}, \\; G_p(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} t \\\\ g_p(t) \\end{bmatrix},$$ the critical $p_0$ value will be such that $$F_{p_0}(t_0) = G_{p_0}(t_0),\\text{ and } \\dot{F}_{p_0}(t_0) = \\lambda \\dot{G}_{p_0}(t_0)$$ for some $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}, t_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$. In other words, their velocities will point in the same direction (and, perhaps more intuitively, the outward normals of each curve will be parallel, so the graphs \u0026lsquo;kiss\u0026rsquo; at some $t_0$ with the choice of $p_0$).\nNow, we have a fairly simple problem to solve. Because the $x$ component of $F$ and $G$ are always equal, we immediately find that $\\lambda = 1$ for their time derivatives to be equal to each other. Now, that leads us to solve for a $p_0$ and $n$ such that $$ \\begin{aligned} f_{p_0}(t_0) \u0026= g_{p_0}(t_0) \\\\ \\implies p_0^n \u0026= \\frac{1}{t_0} \\end{aligned} $$ and $$ \\begin{aligned} \\dot{f}_{p_0}(t_0) \u0026= \\dot{g}_{p_0}(t_0) \\\\ \\implies -\\ln(p_0)p_0^n \u0026= \\frac{1}{t_0^2} \\end{aligned} $$ So, rather unsatisfyingly, we boiled it down to a system of nonlinear equations $$ \\begin{cases} p_0^n = \\frac{1}{t_0}, \\\\ \\ln(p_0)p_0^n = -\\left(\\frac{1}{t_0}\\right)^2 \\end{cases} $$ which I cannot solve, but Desmos tells me that $p_0 \\approx 0.6922$ and $t_0 \\approx 2.7181$.\nThus, my answer would have been reasonable in some convoluted scenario in which $p \u003c 0.6922$.\n(This answer, too, is not totally right! This is because there may be a larger $p$ value that satisfies $np^n \\leq 1$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ but not for $n\\in \\mathbb{R}^+$. We solved for the $n \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$ case, which would technically give us a lower bound for $p_0$. Taking this into consideration, our $p_0$ value would really be $p_0 \\approx 0.6934$)\n","permalink":"https://hasithv.github.io/posts/07-29-24-nothowprobabilityworks/","summary":"I was recently doing a probability puzzle that I can\u0026rsquo;t quite remember the context of, but I came across the answer that the probability would be $$\\mathbb{P}(X) = n p^n \\; \\quad \\forall \\: n\\in\\mathbb{N}, p \\in [0,1].$$ But this is obviously wrong!
